After conception, pregnant women who undergo hemodynamic and metabolic changes, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), may further develop cardiovascular and endocrinologic complications.1, 2, 3, 4 Approximately 5% to 10% of pregnant women may develop hypertension in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.5, 6 This gestational hypertension (GHT) may progress into preeclampsia with proteinuria or eclampsia with tonic-clonic seizures, conditions dangerous to both the infant and expectant mother. Women with hypertension during pregnancy (HDP), preeclampsia, or eclampsia are at elevated risk for preterm delivery, small for gestational age and stillbirth, and low-birth-weight infants.5, 7 Approximately 1% to 14% of pregnant women may have a high blood glucose level diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy.8, 9 This gestational DM (GDM) can not only impose risks of growth abnormality on the baby but also increase the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension.10, 11 Both HDP and GDM are generally short-term disorders for most healthy pregnant women.

A recent study reported that women with HDP have a 10.8-fold increased risk of chronic kidney disease and a 14.8-fold increased risk of end-stage renal disease.12 It is possible that women with HDP are at elevated risk for subsequent hypertension and DM before developing end-stage renal disease. Gestational DM may predispose a woman to a higher risk of progressing to preeclampsia and postpartum DM.1, 13, 14 A study in New York found that women with GDM have an extremely high short-term risk of postpartum DM and cardiovascular complications.1
Few women may experience both HDP and GDM. However, few studies have investigated the risks of postpartum maternal and fetal complications for women with these 2 conditions.14, 15, 16 Most studies investigated the postpartum outcomes associated with HDP only or GDM only.17, 18, 19, 20 With the advantage of large population claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the postpartum risk of hypertension and DM for women with HDP alone and women with both HDP and GDM.

Data SourceGo
The NHI program of Taiwan has covered more than 99% of its 23 million inhabitants and contracted with more than 95% of its hospitals and clinics since 1999.12 We obtained the reimbursement claims data from the National Health Research Institutes, which manages the NHI databases. For this study, we used 2 sets of claims data. One data set included all the inpatient claims data for all insured females (N=14,079,089). The other data set comprised claims data for 1,000,000 people randomly selected from all insured individuals with similar distributions in sex and age. All the data can be linked with surrogate identifications scrambled by the National Health Research Institutes. Information on patient demographic status and health care received are available. Diseases were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Because personal information in the claims data has been protected using surrogate identifications, this study was exempted from the consents of the study population. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee at China Medical University and Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. We followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki to conduct this study.

Study Cohort IdentificationGo
From the inpatient claims data of 14,079,089 females, we identified 1,909,304 pregnant women from 1996 through 2011 (Figure 1). Of these women, 55,805 had HDP (ICD-9-CM code 642). We excluded those with HDP diagnosed before 2000 (n=15,330); those with a history of hypertension, DM, or HDP and GDM (ICD-9-CM codes 401-405, 250, and 648.0 and 648.8, respectively) (n=5140); and those younger than 14 years or older than 45 years (n=124). Of the remaining 35,211 women with HDP diagnosed in 2000-2011, 1270 with both HDP and GDM were selected as the HDP/GDM cohort. We randomly selected women with HDP without GDM as the HDP/non-GDM cohort, frequency matched 4:1 to each woman with HDP/GDM by age and year of pregnancy (n=5077; 3 women in the 40- to 44-year-old group could not be matched).

Of the 484,596 females in the 1,000,000 insured population, 88,426 were identified as being pregnant. We excluded those with HDP diagnosed before 2000 (n=1555); those with a history of hypertension, DM, or GDM (n=5180) by 2000; and those younger than 14 years or older than 45 years (n=5666). Among the remaining 76,025 women without HDP or GDM, we randomly selected pregnant women 2-fold of the cohort with HDP, frequency matched by age and year of pregnancy, as the comparison cohort (n=12,594; [48 women in the 35- to 39-year-old group and 52 in the 40- to 44-year-old group could not be matched]). All the women were followed up until diagnosis of hypertension or DM or until censorship for death, withdraw from the NHI, or the end of 2011.

Statistical AnalysesGo
Distributions of age, urbanization level of residential area, occupation, and comorbidity among the HDP/GDM, HDP/non-GDM, and comparison cohorts were compared. The urbanization levels of study participants' residential areas were categorized into 5 levels based on hierarchy scores estimated by population density, educational level, portions of the elderly and agriculture workers, and physicians per 100,000 people.21 We categorized study participants' occupations into office workers, manual laborers, and others. Office workers were those who conducted civil, professional, managerial, or administrative work. Manual laborers included farmers, fishermen, vendors, and industrial and mechanical laborers. We pooled unemployed and low-income women into the group of others. Comorbidities that might be associated with the pregnancy outcomes were also compared, including stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, renal disease, and placental abruption. We used ?2, analysis of variance, and Fisher exact tests to examine the differences and analysis of variance to examine means among groups.

Postpartum hypertension and DM by the end of 2011 were estimated. With valid proportional hazards assumptions, we used the Kaplan-Meier method to plot the cumulative permanent postpartum incident hypertension and DM among 3 cohorts, and the log-rank test was used to examine the difference. We further calculated the incidence rates and 95% CIs of these 2 postpartum disorders by age for the 3 cohorts. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to calculate the age-specific adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs of these 2 disorders for the HDP/GDM cohort compared with the HDP/non-GDM and comparison cohorts and for the HDP/non-GDM cohort compared with the comparison cohort, controlling for renal disease and urbanization level. We also evaluated whether preeclampsia and eclampsia were associated with postpartum incident hypertension and DM by preeclampsia and eclampsia, and we used the Cox method to measure the aHRs of these 2 disorders for the HDP/non-GDM and HDP/GDM cohorts compared with the comparison cohort, controlling for age, renal disease, and urbanization level.
